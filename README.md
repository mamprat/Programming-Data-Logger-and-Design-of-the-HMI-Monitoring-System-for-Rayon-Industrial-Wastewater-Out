# Programming-Data-Logger-and-Design-of-the-HMI-Monitoring-System-for-Rayon-Industrial-Wastewater-Out

Monitoring waste water outlets is used to reduce environmental pollution loads and reduce 
the impact on human health that is influenced by the environment, using wastewater quality 
parameters that match quality standards. This concept of monitoring aims to facilitate 
workers in an industry especially in the of Waste Water Treatment Plant or WWTP to 
determine the temperature, pH and total suspended solid or TSS levels in waste water 
outlets in the rayon industry. In the testing of this monitoring system, the actual waste outlet 
environment is not used, but the testing is done by modeling the waste outlet while using 
waste water material samples from the rayon industry. The linear regression approach is 
used to analyze TSS levels in wastewater outlets in the rayon industry using Arduino Mega 
as a controller used to detect these parameters. The management of data from the 
monitoring is then stored in the data logger device as the data resulted fron the monitoring 
by storing the data in the form of time and quality detection results in wastewater and is 
integrated with HMI Nextion devices as the display and as a sensor offset settings from 
outlet of wastewater. The results of this monitoring will make it easier for workers to 
analyze the condition of waste water outlets and take countermeasures so as to reduce the 
pollution burden and reduce the impact on human health.
